# Simplified: a Linkinus Style #
[http://benalman.com/projects/simplified-style/](http://benalman.com/projects/simplified-style/)

Version: 2.0, Last updated: 8/28/2009

Simplified is a WebKit message style for the popular OS X [Linkinus](http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus) IRC application. While developed independently of the Linkinus app, great effort was spent working with the app development team to not only tailor Simplified to it, but to also enhance the app style API for Simplified and other message styles. As a result, the Simplified source is modular and well-organized, and style authors are encouraged to use Simplified as a framework for building their own styles.

Simplified is included with Linkinus 2.0.2 and newer, but updates will made available here first as the style is updated.
